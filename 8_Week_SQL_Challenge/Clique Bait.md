# Introduction #

Clique Bait is not like your regular online seafood store - the founder and CEO Danny, was also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry!

In this case study - you are required to support Dannyâ€™s vision and analyse his dataset and come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.

## A. Digital Analysis ##

where e.event_type = 3
```

from events
group by visit_id
)
select sum(checkout) as Sum_checkout, sum(purchase) as Sum_purchase,
1 - (sum(purchase)*1.0/sum(checkout)) as Percentage
from cte
```

```

## B. Product Funnel Analysis ##

### Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details: ###

How many times was each product viewed?

How many times was each product added to cart?

How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?

How many times was each product purchased?

```sql
create table #individual_pf
(
page_name varchar(50),
pageviews int,
cartsadd int,
cartsaddnotpurchase int,
cartsaddpurchase int
)

with cte as(
select e.visit_id, page_name,
sum(case when event_type = 1 then 1 else 0 end) as PageViews,
sum(case when event_type = 2 then 1 else 0 end) as CartsAdd
from events e join page_hierarchy ph
on e.page_id = ph.page_id
where product_category is not null
group by e.visit_id, page_name),

cte2 as(
select distinct(visit_id) as Purchaseid
from events where event_type = 3),

cte3 as(
select *, 
(case when purchaseid is not null then 1 else 0 end) as Purchase
from cte left join cte2
on visit_id = purchaseid),

cte4 as(
select page_name, sum(pageviews) as PageViews, sum(cartsadd) as CartsAdd, 
sum(case when cartsadd = 1 and purchase = 0 then 1 else 0
	end) as CartsAddNotPurchase,
sum(case when cartsadd = 1 and purchase = 1 then 1 else 0
	end) as CartsAddPurchase
from cte3
group by page_name)

insert into #individual_pf (page_name, pageviews, cartsadd, cartsaddnotpurchase, cartsaddpurchase)
select page_name, pageviews, cartsadd, cartsaddnotpurchase, cartsaddpurchase
from cte4

select * from #individual_pf
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77920592/198271139-904b1a83-9938-4182-96c1-afc970cc54c2.png)

### Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products. ###
```sql
create table #category_pf
(
product_category varchar(50),
pageviews int,
cartsadd int,
cartsaddnotpurchase int,
cartsaddpurchase int
)

with cte as(
select e.visit_id, page_name, product_category,
sum(case when event_type = 1 then 1 else 0 end) as PageViews,
sum(case when event_type = 2 then 1 else 0 end) as CartsAdd
from events e join page_hierarchy ph
on e.page_id = ph.page_id
where product_category is not null
group by e.visit_id, product_category, page_name),

cte2 as(
select distinct(visit_id) as Purchaseid
from events where event_type = 3),

cte3 as(
select *, 
(case when purchaseid is not null then 1 else 0 end) as Purchase
from cte left join cte2
on visit_id = purchaseid),

cte4 as(
select product_category, sum(pageviews) as PageViews, sum(cartsadd) as CartsAdd, 
sum(case when cartsadd = 1 and purchase = 0 then 1 else 0
	end) as CartsAddNotPurchase,
sum(case when cartsadd = 1 and purchase = 1 then 1 else 0
	end) as CartsAddPurchase
from cte3
group by product_category)

insert into #category_pf (product_category, pageviews, cartsadd, cartsaddnotpurchase, cartsaddpurchase)
select product_category, pageviews, cartsadd, cartsaddnotpurchase, cartsaddpurchase
from cte4

select * from #category_pf
```

Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

### Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases? ###

Most views: Oyster

Most cart adds: Lobster

Most purchases: Lobster

### Which product was most likely to be abandoned? ###
Russian Caviar

### Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage? ###
```sql
select page_name, round(cartsaddpurchase * 100.0/pageviews,2) as ViewtoPurchase
from #individual_pf
order by round(cartsaddpurchase * 100.0/pageviews,2) desc
```

### What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add? ###
```sql
select avg(round(cartsadd * 100.0/ pageviews,2)) as ConversionRate
from #individual_pf
```

### What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase? ###
```sql
select avg(round(cartsaddpurchase * 100.0/ cartsadd,2)) as ConversionRate
from #individual_pf
```

## C. Campaigns Analysis ##

### Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns: ###

- user_id
- visit_id
- visit_start_time: the earliest event_time for each visit
- page_views: count of page views for each visit
- cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit
- purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
- campaign_name: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
- impression: count of ad impressions for each visit
- click: count of ad clicks for each visit
- (Optional column) cart_products: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)

```sql
create table campaign_analysis
(
user_id int,
visit_id varchar(20),
start_time datetime2(3),
page_views int,
cart_adds int,
purchase int,
impressions int, 
click int, 
Campaign varchar(200),
cart_products varchar(200)
);

with cte as
(
select distinct user_id, visit_id, min(event_time) as start_time,
sum(case when event_type = 1 then 1 else 0 end) as page_views,
sum(case when event_type = 2 then 1 else 0 end) as cart_adds,
sum(case when event_type = 3 then 1 else 0 end) as purchase,
sum(case when event_type = 4 then 1 else 0 end) as impressions,
sum(case when event_type = 5 then 1 else 0 end) as click,
case
when min(event_time) > '2020-01-01 00:00:00' and min(event_time) < '2020-01-14 00:00:00'
		then 'BOGOF - Fishing For Compliments'
when min(event_time) > '2020-01-15 00:00:00' and min(event_time) < '2020-01-28 00:00:00'
		then '25% Off - Living The Lux Life'
when min(event_time) > '2020-02-01 00:00:00' and min(event_time) < '2020-03-31 00:00:00'
		then 'Half Off - Treat Your Shellf(ish)' 
else NULL
end as Campaign,
string_agg(case when product_id IS NOT NULL AND event_type = 2 
			then page_name ELSE NULL END, ', ') AS cart_products
from events e join users u on e.cookie_id = u.cookie_id
join page_hierarchy ph on e.page_id = ph.page_id
group by visit_id, user_id
)

insert into campaign_analysis 
(user_id, visit_id, start_time, page_views, cart_adds, purchase, impressions, click, Campaign, cart_products)
select user_id, visit_id, start_time, page_views, cart_adds, purchase, impressions, click, Campaign, cart_products
from cte;

select * from campaign_analysis
```

### What is the percentage of each campaign being participated? ###
```sql
select campaign, count(*) as count,
round(count(*)*100.0/(select count(*) from campaign_analysis),2) as Percentage
from campaign_analysis
group by campaign
```
