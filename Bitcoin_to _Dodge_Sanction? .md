SWIFT as sanction is imposed to Russia while the crisis in Ukraine escalated to a full-scale invasion ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Sanction has been proven to be efficient in the historical records to ‘punish’ countries for atrocities committed. For instance, SWIFT sanction has been imposed to Iran in 2012  as a result of the country’s nuclear programme and only lifted when a nuclear agreement comes into place. The sanction has caused immediate impacts to the Iranian economy, particularly the oil production and GDP growth where both of them were collapsing. The currency has also weakened, resulting in a serious inflation soaring from 7% in 2018 to more than 50% in 2019. Despite SWIFT sanction is a a double-edged sword that will hurt the economy in the western countries, such as Germany, which relies on Russia for around half its natural gas. 

While some of the Russian banks are still allowed to remain in the SWIFT system as they facilitate the trade of oil and gas with EU countries, but the minority would not be sufficient to counter the massive financial impacts resulted from this sanction. Cutting a nation’s banks off from it can make life extremely difficult for them when international trades can no longer happen when there is no payment getaway. In 2017, Russia imports $226.96 billion worth of goods from the world. Considering full 2021, imports increased 26.5 percent to $296.1 billion. 

The cancellation is speculated to have an impact on the price movement of cryptocurrencies if Russia is to leverage on their cryptocurrencies reserves. Cryptocurrencies contrasts traditional payment systems all users are seen equally, presenting opportunities for those under scrutiny to escape with their wealth in cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies can be exchanged without the need for a bank, meaning that it might gives Russia a channel to perform transaction with other countries without their payments going through the bank. While the Russian currency has plunged to a record low, more and more Russians are converting their money into cryptocurrencies to hedge risk amid the sanction, pushing the prices up. However, does the assumption of using cryptocurrencies to dodge sanction hold? In my perspective, this assumption does not hold due to the following reasons:

## Will cryptocurrencies save Russia from sanction? ##
First, the current market capitalization of Bitcoin is estimated to be around $1.03 trillion (as of 11 March 2021). On the other hand, the GBP of Russia as of 2021 is reported to be $1.65 trillion, far more less than sufficient for Russia to adopt Bitcoin in doing transaction. Besides, using other privacy-focused digital currencies such as Monero would not work either due to the even smaller market capitalization. 

If we were to look at the crypto ownership today, there is only a mere 3% of the global population are exposed to the cryptocurrencies, while it does not account for over 0.3% of their overall net worth. 

Second, should Russia adopts cryptocurrencies to conduct trade, these  cryptocurrencies would need to be converted into USD. Converting any cryptocurrency into a fiat currency is easier said than done, especially when the amount involved is that huge. Bank will have to get involved at the end of the day. Conversion of such as huge amount will certainly lead to serious price plummet during every sell-off, meaning that Russia would never be able to convert sufficient amount of money. 

Third, US and Europe have approached Binance and Coinbase to freeze all Russian accounts amid fears cryptocurrencies to be used to evade sanctions, while initially both of these companies turned down the requests by claiming that everyone deserve access to financial services, Coinbase has started to ban accounts linked to Russian individuals and businesses that look suspicious through proactive investigation. Meanwhile, the founder of Binance, Zhao, mentioned that it is entirely impossible to use cryptocurrencies to dodge sanction, justifying with the fact that cryptocurrencies are not an effective tool for illicit activities. The crypto trading has already become highly traceable due to the strengthened legal enforcement by government of different countries. 

Russia might be able to still cryptocurrencies to dodge the sanction, but I personally believe that the impact is only minimal. 

## How does the sanction affect crypto prices? ##
Let’s take a glance into the Russian crypto market. According to August 2021 data from the University of Cambridge, Russia is the third-largest country for bitcoin mining. It is estimated that over 17.3 million people, 11.9% of Russia’s total population, currently own cryptocurrency. There are in total 1200k crypto wallets in Russia, holding an amount exceeding $239 billions. 

As mentioned, a large proportion of Russian have converted their money into cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, skyrocketing the crypto prices. Data from Binance shows the volume of the BTC/RUB trading pair spiked more than 400% on Feb 24 and 240% on Feb 28, indicating a demand surge. It also demonstrates the increase in number of addresses that are holding an amount of greater than $1, confirming that more people are coming into the crypto scene, whether to use it against sanction or to preserve wealth in the period of uncertainties. There comes in the questions whether this price surge will last, and if it could be the beginning of another bullish crypto market. 

Assuming that Russian is purchasing crypto to escape the sanction rather than to preserve wealth, their turning to bitcoin would be very different from investors viewing it as a safe bet. The money flows into cryptocurrencies will eventually be transferred out as the money invested in cryptocurrencies is not spare money but the money used to sustain living, and the initial purpose of purchasing cryptocurrencies is not using it as an investment tool but to evade sanction. This could be the reason why BTC prices remain volatile in the recent days, prompting the lack of confidence still. 

In my perspective, crypto networks only stand to benefit for a short period of time and it is expected to witness a drop in the very near future.
