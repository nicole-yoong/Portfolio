# Question: #

Twitter wants to roll out more push notifications to users because they think users are missing out on good content. Twitter decides to do this in an A/B test.

Say that after more notifications are released, there is a sudden increase in the total number of unsubscribes.

We’re given two tables: events where actions are ‘login’, ‘nologin’, and ‘unsubscribe’ and another table called variants where user’s are bucketed into a control and a variant A/B test.

Given these tables, write a query to display a graph to understand how unsubscribes are affecting login rates over time.

Note: Let’s say that all users are automatically put into the A/B test.
