## Rank ##
It returns the rank of each row as a number. This rank is determined by the sorting criteria specified within the RANK() statement's brackets.

Find the Name, Genre, and Size of the smallest game in our database.
```sql
with ranking_cte as
(
  select name, genre, size, rank() over(order by size asc) as rank
  from game
)

select name, genre, size
from ranking_cte 
where rank = 1
```

## Dense_Rank ##
It gives a "dense" rank indeed â€“ there are no gaps in the numbering.

## Row_Number ##
It gives a unique rank to each row. The order is nondeterministic.

### Differences ###
For each game, show its name, genre, and date of release. In the next three columns, show each game's RANK(), DENSE_RANK() and ROW_NUMBER() sorted by the date of release. Name these columns Rank, DenseRank, and RowNumber
```sql
select name, genre, releasedate,
rank() over(order by releasedate) as Rank,
dense_rank() over(order by releasedate) as DenseRank,
row_number() over(order by releasedate) as RowNumber
from game
```

## NTILE(X) ##
It distributes the rows into a set number of groups, which is specified by X.

We want to divide games into four groups based on size, with the biggest games coming first. For each game, show its Name, Genre, Size, and the GroupNo it belongs to.
```sql
select name, genre, size, 
ntile(4) over(order by size desc) as GroupNo
from game
```
