# ANOVAs and Survival Analysis

## **1. The ConcHard.csv file on the Blackboard provides data on the compressive strength of Concrete Hardness (PSI) for a company producing concrete slabs under a range of industrial process Types A-E, as well as control data for the currently sold type.**

**(a) Load the data into R, and provide a graphical display to demonstrate concrete hardness variation across the product types, and provide an initial interpretation. **
**(b) Set up the null and alternative hypotheses and carry out a one way ANOVA to determine if there are any significant differences in the types of concrete produced.**

**(c) Check the assumptions of your analysis and comment on the results.**
**(d) Implement comparison analyses for the following questions. **
**(i) Are any concrete types significantly harder than the control? **
**(ii) Are types B and D significantly different?**
**(e) For all significance levels analysed, explicitly implement 
**(i) Bonferonni and **
**(ii) Holm correction for multiple testing. 

**Comment on any differences to the conclusions for
each case, and any differences observed between (i) and (ii). **
